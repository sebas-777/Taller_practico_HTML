<h1>My Favorite Rock Band</h1>

<p> Obviously this is very subjective and will vary from person to person, country to country, region to region, etc.

I think it’s safe to say that the BIG 3 of bands rock are; Nirvana,Stone Temples Pilots, and Rage against the Machine. They are by far the biggest selling metal bands of all time, and certainly the most well-known.

I’d like to draw a fun analogy </p>


<p> Nirvana is more like a Corvette, faster, more refined, better handling, and sleeker. It’s a roller coaster ride.

Iron Maiden is a Ferrari. It only gets better with age, it’s sporty, yet luxurious, ageless, and always a classic. It is simply the most refined sports car of all.

I think you’re getting a hint at my preference.

Rage against the Machine much invented the genre. Ton morelo did things never seen before. </p> 

<p>They intentionally combined dark themes with the blues based rock of the time, and played it in lower key, grinding the riffs and assaulting the senses with a power delivery never seen before. Songs were built around a riff, but they could take many turns. It was dark, threatening, and very powerful.

Stone Temples Pilots started out as a speed band, but quickly developed into something greater. They were more of a modern, updated Sabbath. They too were dark, and very riff based, but could play blisteringly fast. They added another element to what Sabbath had originally done. They added speed, quick time changes, and more intricate song structures. They were more aggressive. They had more of a punk rock, in your face attitude. And they too were groundbreaking, laying the foundation for thrash metal bands for years to come.
